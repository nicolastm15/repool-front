## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the backend application, you'll need a PostgreSQL instance.
If you have Docker installed on your machine, you can use the docker-compose.yml file in the root of the project to quickstart an instance of PostgreSQL.

Run the following command and a PostgreSQL container will be started:

```
docker-compose up
```

After installing NodeJS, run the following command to download all of the project's dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the following command to start the server:

```
npm run start
```

To add the schema to the database, you must run the migration. For this, run:

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will generate the migration named **init**.
To enter random test data into the migration, use the command:

```
npx prisma db seed --preview-feature
```

## Test API's

API tests can be conducted through the client folder at the root of the project. The user.http file refers to actions that can be executed by any user, subscriber.http refers to actions that can be performed by any user subscribed to the platform and logged in, owner.http contains actions that can be executed by property-owner users, and admin.http contains actions for the system administrator.
