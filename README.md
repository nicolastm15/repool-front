# Repool: A Rent Service for University Republics

This projects was created for a discipline at college. It's a web app to aid university students in finding a place to live close to college.

The goal of this project is to develop a software solution to assist interested individuals (likely university students) in finding and renting temporary accommodations near universities.

When a student is accepted into a university, a new challenge begins, which is to prepare to study.
With SISU (a brazilian univertity application system), individuals from any part of the country or abroad who took the ENEM exam can apply for a university spot.
Once approved, it becomes necessary for the future student to make plans to be able to study.
For some, transportation between neighborhoods and citites is enough, while for others who live further away it is necessary to seek temporary accommodations that are closer to the university.
Most of these students, with a limited budget, seek to share space with other interested people and reduce rental expenses.
However, searching for a relatively safe, cheap, and close-to-university place in an unfamiliar city can be a challenge for many.

Moreover, from another perspective, there is the opportunity for local residents with idle spaces to profit from renting out their properties.

Therefore, we see that there is a need to connect property owners with interested parties, considering demands such as cost sharing, proximity to the study environment, clarification of costs, and any other characteristics that may be of interest to potential tenants.
